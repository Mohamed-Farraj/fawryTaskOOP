# E-Commerce System - Internship Task

##  Project Overview

This is a simple console-based e-commerce system designed as part of a Full Stack Development Internship challenge. The system allows customers to:

- Define products (shippable, expirable, or both)
- Add products to their cart with quantity checks
- Checkout with full validation
- Calculate shipping fees for shippable items
- Handle expired products and stock limitations
- Print checkout details and shipping notice

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- Java 17+
- Object-Oriented Design
- Interfaces (`IShippable`, `IExpireable`)
- Console-based interaction

---


##  How to Run

1. Open the project in your Java IDE (IntelliJ, Eclipse, VSCode, etc.)
2. Run the `Main.java` class
3. Console output will display shipping details and checkout receipt
